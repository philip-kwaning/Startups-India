Sector: Sector of service

### HYPOTHESIS
Hypothesis : Stage and Having a Specified Amount

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no association between a company's stage and whether it has funding above a specified threshold.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Companies in a particular stage are more likely to have funding amounts above a specified threshold.

### Interpretation of the p-value:

A very small p-value (close to zero) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
In this case, the p-value is much smaller than conventional significance levels (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01), suggesting that you would reject the null hypothesis.

### Conclusion:

With a p-value this small, you would typically conclude that there is significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
Therefore, you may infer that there is a significant relationship between the "Sector" and "Stage" variables in your data.
